‚≠ê _New technology learned during this project_

## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app, practicing known and exploring _new_ technologies (see above). I learned these new tools independently by reading its documentation, consulting forums like StackOverlfow and watching online videos.

- practice full-stack app development
- build a working prototype in 2 weeks
- apply what we learned in Codaisseur's bootcamp
- extend with new technology independently
- showcase and document development skills using:
  - [wireframes]() as Minimum Viable Product
  - conscious [data model]() design
  - user stories perspective
  - agile/[kanban project](https://github.com/Til-van-Sluisveld/FE-InstaGallery/projects/1) approach
  - transparant and structured [git version control](#git-version-control)

## User stories

<!-- - As a page visitor, I can sign up and log in as a user. I must register before I can post food palettes and recipes
- As a visitor, I am able see existing food palettes and recipes as a gallery
- As a user, I am able to post new food palettes
- As a user, I am able to post new recipes
- As a visitor, I can see recipes of interest and get their details for cooking.
- As a visitor, I can select food palettes and filter for corresponding recipes
- _planned:_ As a user, I can like recipes and foodpaletes
- _planned:_ As a user, I can bookmark recipes and foodpaletes -->
