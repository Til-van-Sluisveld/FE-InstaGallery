### Sell your instagram photo's Online!

## What this app is about

[Find out here for a working version](https://instagallery.netlify.app/)

Two of my major hobbies are Travel and Photography. I like to combine thes hobbies and upload photo's of my travels on instagram. Someone commented on one of my pictures asking me if he could have the photo so he could print it out and hang it on his wall. So I wanted to create a webshop using the photographs i had already uploaded to instagram.

I have friends that share my hobby. I figured they would be interested in also start selling their photographs. So instead of creating a single webshop I wanted to create a webshop creator.

Enter InstaGallery.

‚≠ê _New technology learned during this project_

## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app, practicing known and exploring _new_ technologies (see above). I learned these new tools independently by reading its documentation, consulting forums like StackOverlfow and watching online videos.

- practice full-stack app development
- build a working prototype in 2 weeks
- apply what we learned in Codaisseur's bootcamp
- extend with new technology independently
- showcase and document development skills using:
  - [wireframes](https://github.com/Til-van-Sluisveld/FE-InstaGallery/tree/development/project/Wireframes) as Minimum Viable Product
  - conscious [data model](https://github.com/Til-van-Sluisveld/FE-InstaGallery/blob/development/project/DataModel.png) design
  - user stories perspective
  - agile/[kanban project](https://github.com/Til-van-Sluisveld/FE-InstaGallery/projects/1) approach
  - transparant and structured [git version control](#git-version-control)

## User stories

- As a photograper I want to sell photos I have already uploaded to instagram
- As a photographer i want to be notified once someone bought one of my photographs
- As a person who love photography I can find instagram users photo pages, so I can admire their work.
- As a person who loves photography I want to select a photo and view its details
- As a person who loves photography I want to order a photo, so I can support my favorite photographers
